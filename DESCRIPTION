Description: The sole function in this eponymously named package computes the exponential of a number, vector of numbers, or a (numeric) variable in a tibble. This is done recursively, via a truncated approximation of the Taylor-series definition of the exponential function. This function can be used to reverse logarithmic transformations of numerical variables, as shown in the last example below.
